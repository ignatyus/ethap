## :bookmark_tabs: Introduction
ETHAP is an interactive data analysis tool that can be given to any Ethereum account and analyze the account’s transaction behaviour.  
It has a machine learning model that predicts the account's profile.  
The model is trained on hundreds of millions of transactions.
